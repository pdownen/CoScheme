To help study the behavior and correctness of composable copattern matching, we model a simplified version of the library API in the form of an extended $\lambda$-calculus, and
give a high-level translation into a conventional $\lambda$-calculus with recursion and pattern matching (given in \cref{fig:target-syntax}).
Our pattern language is modeled after a small common core found among various implementations of Scheme, which includes normal variable wildcards $x$ that can match anything, quoted symbols $\q{x}$, and lists of the form $\Null$ or $(\Cons P \, P')$.
Note that we assume all bound variables $x$ in a pattern are distinct.
As shorthand, we write a list of patterns $P_1 ~ P_2 ~ \dots ~ P_n$ for $(\Cons P_1 ~ (\Cons P_2 ~ \dots (\Cons P_n \Null)))$.
To model the patterns found in typed functional languages like ML and Haskell, such as constructor applications $K ~ \many{P}$, we can represent the constructor as a quoted symbol $\q{K}$ and the application as a list $\q{K} ~ \many{P}$.
The patterns' specifics are surprisingly not essential to the main copattern translation and could be extended with other features found in more specific implementations.

For simplicity, this translation begins from a smaller source language with copatterns (given in \cref{fig:source-syntax}) separated into three main syntactic categories that reflect the different groups of values from the macro library:
\begin{itemize}
\item[($M, N$)] \emph{Term} syntax represents all ordinary expressions of the host langauge as well as the new first-class \emph{objects} of the library.
  The new forms of terms are $\lamstar B$, which gives a self-referential copattern-matching object, along with $\Template B$ and $\Extension O$ which include the other two syntactic categories as first-class values that can be applied as functions to instantiate their open-ended recursion and composition.
\item[($B$)] \emph{Template} syntax represents a simplified grammar supported by \scm|template| and similar macros specified as \scm|TemplateStx| in \cref{fig:macro-syntax}.
  Including some extension cases in a template is written as $O; B$, the catch-all clause which may continue the loop again via a recursive object bound to $x$ is written as $\Continue x \to M$, and the closed case where the catch-all clause raises an error is the empty string $\varepsilon$.
  Since the simpler final $\Else$ clause is a special case of $\Continue$, we treat it as syntactic sugar.
\item[($O$)] \emph{Extension} syntax represents a simplified grammar supported by \scm|extension| and similar macros specified as \scm|ExtensionStx| in \cref{fig:macro-syntax} with terser notation.
  Vertical composition is written as $O; O'$, similar to $O; B$, with the empty string $\varepsilon$ as its neutral element.
  Copattern-matching is written as $Q[x] O$, where $Q$ is a copattern context with $x$ as the root identifier naming the recursive object itself.
  The more basic forms are written as $\lambda P. O$ for a functional abstraction over an extension, $\Match P \gets M ~ O$ for a pattern-matching guard, and $\Try x \to B$ for the statement which binds the following cases to $x$ before running a template specified by $B$.
  We treat if-guards and the form $(= M)$ as syntactic sugar for special cases of the more general forms, and also sometimes use the alternative notation $\Do M$ in place of $(= M)$ in contexts where the latter notation appears awkward.

\end{figure}

The syntax in $B$ and $O$ directly reflects the core operations for forming and combining copattern-matching expressions of the library API.
Here, the copattern syntax $Q[x]$ itself is expressed as a subset of contexts, $Q$, surrounding an object internally named $x$.
Two lines separated by a semicolon ($O; O'$) represents a binary vertical composition \scm|compose| that tries either $O$ or $O'$, 
and $\varepsilon$ represents an empty extension \scm|(extend)| with respect to vertical composition: it immediately refers to the next option.
Prefixing with a copattern-matching expression ($Q[x] ~ O$) represents the \scm|(comatch Q[x] O)| form that tries $Q[x]$ and then $O$.
Smaller special cases of matching include pattern lambdas ($\lambda P. O$) for \scm|try-Î»|, and pattern guards ($\Match P \gets M ~ O$) for \scm|try-match|.
Other operations use the same names as in \cref{fig:api}.

This simplified grammar makes it easier to define the full macro expansion as a translation from the source (\cref{fig:source-syntax}) to target (\cref{fig:target-syntax}) as given in \cref{fig:translation}.
This translation shares many similarities to continuation-passing style (CPS) translations.
However, we explicitly avoid converting the entire program to CPS.
Notably, every syntactic form for the source language is unchanged; for example, $\den{M~N} = \den{M} ~ \den{N}$.
Instead, the only time we need to introduce an extra parameter is for the two new syntactic categories.
All templates are translated to functions that take a value for the whole object itself to a new version of that object.
Similarly, all extensions are translated to functions that take both a template as the ``base case'' to try next and a value for the whole object itself.
Even though this is dynamically-typed, we can view the type of templates as object transformers and extensions as template transformers:
\begin{align*}
  Object &= \text{some type of function}
  \\
  Template &= Object \to Object'
  \\
  Extension &= Template \to Template'
  = Template \to Object \to Object'
\end{align*}

\end{figure}

The interesting cases for translating terms are the new forms.
$\Template B$ and $\Extension O$ are just translated to their given forms as transformation functions.
With $\lamstar B$, we need to recursively plug its translation in for its self parameter.
Note the one detail that the recursive $\mathit{self}$ is $\eta$-expanded to in this application.
This ensures that $\lambda x. \mathit{self} ~ x$ is treated as a value in a real implementation, and is always safe assuming that $B$ describes a function (non-functional cases of $\lamstar B$ are undefined user error).

For templates and extensions, the terminators $\Continue$ and $\Try$ are translated to plain $\lambda$-abstractions that allow the programmer direct access to their implicit parameters.
% Other cases are specific to each form.
Complex copatterns ($x ~ \many{P_1} P_n ~ O$) are reduced down to a simpler sequence of pattern lambdas ($x ~ \lambda P_1. \dots \lambda P_n. ~ O$), and pattern lambdas ($\lambda P. O$) are reduced down to a simpler non-matching lambda followed by an explicit match guard ($\lambda x. \Match P \gets x ~ O$).

This leaves just the base cases of simple extension forms.
Each time an extension (of form $\lambda b. \lambda s. \dots$) ``fails,'' it calls the given next template with the given self object ($b~s$).
A match guard $\den{\Match P \gets M ~ O}$ will try to match the translation of $M$ against the pattern $P$; the success case continues as $E\den{O}$ with the same next template and self.
A non-matching lambda $\den{\lambda x. O}$ always succeeds (for now), but note that the next template to try on failure has to be changed to include the given argument.
Why?
Because the lambda has already consumed the next argument from its context, it would be gone if, later on, the following operations fail and move on to the next option.
So instead of invoking the given $b$ directly as $b~s'$ (for a potentially different future $s'$), they need to invoke $b$ applied to this argument $x$ as $b~s'~x$.
% Finally, the $\den{\Nest O}$ operation is defined by recursively creating a new value for the self parameter by recursively taking a new snapshot of how the object looks now after all the preceding applications and matchings have already occurred.

In this translation, we also give the $\eta$-reduced forms on the right-hand side when available.
This shows that the empty extension $\varepsilon$ is just the identity function (given the next thing $b$ to try, $\varepsilon$ does nothing and immediately moves on to $b$), and horizontal composition $O; O'$ is just ordinary function composition.
